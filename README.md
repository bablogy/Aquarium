# Aquarium
A virtual aquarium in C++ from scratch  

The code is first published in 2005 (while I was an electrical student engineer) on :
https://codes-sources.commentcamarche.net/source/34564-aquarium-virtuel-16-bits

It is a virtual Aquarium written in the C++ language. 

Initally the program was writtend in C language using the turbo C++ 3.0 on a WINDOWS XP machine. 

Then the code was translated to the C++ using Oriented Object Programming (OOP) approch. 

A similar approach was developed in 2017 by TechnoPanti7 on youtube :
